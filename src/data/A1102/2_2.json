    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>ðŸ”’ Protocols and Encryption</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2):</strong> Uses AES encryption; strong security for wireless networks. Still widely used but being replaced by WPA3.</li>\n    <li><strong>WPA3:</strong> Improved version of WPA2. Stronger encryption, better protection against brute-force attacks, and improved public network security.</li>\n    <li><strong>TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol):</strong> Older encryption used with WPA. Considered insecure and deprecated in modern networks.</li>\n    <li><strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):</strong> Symmetric encryption used in WPA2/WPA3. Provides strong data confidentiality.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>ðŸ”‘ Authentication Methods</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>RADIUS:</strong> Centralized protocol for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA). Common in enterprise Wi-Fi networks.</li>\n    <li><strong>TACACS+:</strong> More secure AAA protocol than RADIUS. Used for managing access to network devices like routers/switches.</li>\n    <li><strong>Kerberos:</strong> Ticket-based network authentication. Uses symmetric encryption and is standard in enterprise domains (like Windows AD).</li>\n    <li><strong>Multifactor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Requires two or more factors: something you know (password), have (device), or are (biometrics).</li>\n  </ul>\n</article>"
