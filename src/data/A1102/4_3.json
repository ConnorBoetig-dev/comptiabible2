Most time-consuming, but easiest to restore.</li>\n    <li><strong>Incremental:</strong> ➕ Only backs up what changed since the last backup of any kind. Fast backups, slower restore.</li>\n    <li><strong>Differential:</strong> 📘 Backs up changes since the last full backup. Grows larger over time, but faster to restore than incremental.</li>\n    <li><strong>Synthetic:</strong> 🧬 Combines full and incremental into a virtual full backup without re-copying data. Efficient and storage-friendly.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>🧪 Backup Testing</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> ⏱️ Regularly test backups to ensure they’re valid and restorable.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>🔁 Backup Rotation Schemes</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>On Site vs. Off Site:</strong> 🏢 vs. ☁️ — Keep one local for fast recovery, one remote for disaster protection.</li>\n    <li><strong>Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS):</strong> 👴 👨 👦 — Son = daily, Father = weekly, Grandfather = monthly.</li>\n    <li><strong>3-2-1 Backup Rule:</strong> 📂 3 total copies, 💽 2 local on different devices, ☁️ 1 off-site copy.</li>\n  </ul>\n</article>"
