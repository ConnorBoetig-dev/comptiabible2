Used under memory pressure, but shouldn't be relied on long-term.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📏 SODIMM (Small Outline DIMM)</h3>\n    <p>Smaller RAM sticks used in laptops and compact PCs.<br />Shorter and fewer pins than desktop DIMMs.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Desktop = DIMM, Laptop = SODIMM.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>💾 DDR3 / DDR4 / DDR5</h3>\n    <p>Double Data Rate memory — transfers data on both edges of the clock cycle.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>DDR3:</strong> Older, up to ~2133 MHz</li>\n      <li><strong>DDR4:</strong> Common today, ~2133–3200+ MHz</li>\n      <li><strong>DDR5:</strong> Newest, faster, more efficient</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Not backward compatible — each generation needs a matching motherboard.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🛡️ ECC (Error Correction Code) RAM</h3>\n    <p>Includes extra bits to detect and fix memory errors. Used in servers and critical systems.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> ECC is slower and pricier, and usually won’t work in regular consumer motherboards.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <h2>🔀 RAM Channel Configurations</h2>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>Single-Channel</h3>\n    <p>One stick of RAM — functional but slower.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>Dual-Channel</h3>\n    <p>Two sticks installed in matching paired slots (color-coded). Doubles data path and improves performance.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Always check the motherboard manual for correct slot configuration.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>Triple-Channel</h3>\n    <p>Seen on some older Intel platforms. Needs 3 matching sticks in the right configuration.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>Quad-Channel</h3>\n    <p>Used in high-end desktops and workstations. Offers peak bandwidth with 4 identical modules.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Channel setup affects performance more than just raw RAM speed.</p>\n  </section>\n</article>"
