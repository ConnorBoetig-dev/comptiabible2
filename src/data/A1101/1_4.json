    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>📶 WIRELESS / CELLULAR DATA NETWORK (Enable/Disable)</h2>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📱 2G / 3G / 4G / 5G</h3>\n    <p>These refer to generations of cellular networks:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2G: Text + calls only (GSM/CDMA)</li>\n      <li>3G: Basic mobile internet</li>\n      <li>4G (LTE): Fast mobile data, streaming</li>\n      <li>5G: Ultra-fast, low latency, used for IoT, smart cities</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If the question says \"user can’t access high-speed data,\" check if the phone is stuck on 3G or 2G.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📡 Hotspot</h3>\n    <p>Turns your phone into a Wi-Fi router, sharing your mobile data.</p>\n    <p>Must enable Mobile Hotspot in settings. Requires password to connect securely.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Common troubleshooting scenario: \"User can connect to hotspot but has no internet\" → likely issue with cellular data or hotspot settings.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🌍 GSM vs. CDMA</h3>\n    <p>Two types of older network tech:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>GSM (Global System for Mobile): Uses SIM cards, widely used globally</li>\n      <li>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access): No SIM cards originally; tied to the device (Verizon/older Sprint)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Today, most phones use GSM or LTE-based tech.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If a phone doesn’t work internationally, it’s probably locked to CDMA or doesn’t support GSM bands.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔄 PRL (Preferred Roaming List) Updates</h3>\n    <p>Tells your phone which towers to connect to when roaming. Important for CDMA phones.</p>\n    <p>You usually update it via a code or setting menu (e.g., dialing *228).</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If a user travels and has poor signal even in supported areas, suggest a PRL update.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔵 BLUETOOTH CONFIGURATION</h3>\n    <h4>✅ Enable Bluetooth</h4>\n    <p>Toggle in Settings &gt; Bluetooth. Must be turned on before pairing.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔍 Enable Pairing Mode</h4>\n    <p>Some devices need to be in pairing mode to be detected (e.g., holding a button for 5 sec).</p>\n\n    <h4>🔎 Find a Device for Pairing</h4>\n    <p>Your device will scan nearby Bluetooth devices. Choose the correct name from the list.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔐 Enter PIN Code</h4>\n    <p>Some accessories (like headsets) require a PIN (e.g., 0000, 1234). Modern devices may auto-pair or show matching confirmation codes.</p>\n\n    <h4>🧪 Test Connectivity</h4>\n    <p>After pairing, test by:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Playing music on Bluetooth speaker</li>\n      <li>Making a call with a Bluetooth headset</li>\n      <li>Transferring files</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Be ready to troubleshoot common pairing issues:\n      <br />Device not showing → not in pairing mode\n      <br />Doesn’t connect → wrong PIN or already paired to another device\n    </p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📍 LOCATION SERVICES</h3>\n    <h4>🛰️ GPS (Global Positioning System)</h4>\n    <p>Uses satellites to determine device location. Works even without data, but slower to update. Used in navigation, location-based apps, geotagging.</p>\n\n    <h4>📶 Cellular Location Services</h4>\n    <p>Uses cell towers, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth beacons to estimate position faster than GPS. Used by apps like ride-sharing, maps, weather.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> GPS = outdoors, accurate but slower. Cellular/Wi-Fi = faster, less accurate, works indoors.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🛡️ MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT (MDM) / MOBILE APPLICATION MANAGEMENT (MAM)</h3>\n    <h4>🧭 Corporate Email Configuration</h4>\n    <p>MDMs push email profiles (like Outlook) with pre-set server, port, security info. Helps secure work accounts and simplify setup.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔐 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>\n    <p>Adds security: user must verify identity using a second method, like:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>SMS code</li>\n      <li>App (e.g., Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)</li>\n      <li>Biometric (Face ID, fingerprint)</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If the scenario mentions \"company requires PIN + fingerprint,\" that’s 2FA under MDM.</p>\n\n    <h4>🧩 Corporate Applications</h4>\n    <p>MDMs can remotely install, restrict, or wipe work apps. Prevents data leaks by managing access to company data.</p>\n    <p>🧠 Remember: MDM = device-wide control. MAM = controls apps only (like containerized work email).</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔁 MOBILE DEVICE SYNCHRONIZATION</h3>\n    <h4>📧 Account Setup</h4>\n    <p>Connect mobile to cloud services (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, iCloud). Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Add account.</p>\n\n    <h4>📂 Data to Synchronize</h4>\n    <p>Syncing keeps info consistent across devices:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Mail – Real-time access to email</li>\n      <li>Photos – Backup to cloud (Google Photos, iCloud)</li>\n      <li>Calendar – Sync events across devices</li>\n      <li>Contacts – Shared address book</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Recognizing Data Caps – Some services allow Wi-Fi only sync to save cellular data.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> \"User ran out of data quickly after enabling photo sync\" → disable sync over cellular.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>✅ FINAL EXAM CHECKLIST FOR 1.4 (Middle + Right)</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>GPS = satellite, outdoor accuracy.</li>\n      <li>Cellular location = quick, works indoors.</li>\n      <li>MDM = enforces security and app policy.</li>\n      <li>MAM = controls work apps only.</li>\n      <li>2FA = PIN + biometric or token.</li>\n      <li>Sync setup = Account + what data to sync.</li>\n      <li>Watch for data usage concerns during sync.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </section>\n</article>"
