If they need longer coverage through walls → 2.4GHz</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔢 Channels</h3>\n    <p>Frequencies are divided into channels.</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2.4GHz = 11 channels (but only 1, 6, 11 are non-overlapping in U.S.)</li>\n      <li>5GHz = 23+ channels, mostly non-overlapping</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Channel overlap causes signal interference. Use non-overlapping channels in shared buildings.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔵 Bluetooth</h3>\n    <p>Short-range wireless (~10 meters). Used for headsets, file transfer, keyboard/mouse.</p>\n    <p>🧠 Uses 2.4GHz and frequency hopping to avoid interference</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Know which support dual-band (n, ax), and which are 5GHz-only (a, ac)</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📍 Long-Range Fixed Wireless</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Licensed:</strong> Must register with regulators (FCC in U.S.), less interference</li>\n      <li><strong>Unlicensed:</strong> Open to public (e.g., 2.4GHz), more interference</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Power: Limited by law—too much = fines<br />Regulatory Requirements: Ensure proper use of spectrum, avoid interference</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Used in rural areas, campus buildings, or point-to-point setups</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📲 NFC (Near-Field Communication)</h3>\n    <p>Ultra short-range (≤4 cm). Used for tap-to-pay, ID badges, transit cards. Works by inductive coupling.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Compare to Bluetooth: NFC is faster to connect but works at a much shorter range.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📻 RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)</h3>\n    <p>Uses radio waves to identify tags or devices. Common in:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Inventory tracking</li>\n      <li>Toll tags</li>\n      <li>Access cards</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Passive RFID = no battery, powered by reader. Active RFID = has its own power source</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>✅ Exam Quick Hits</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>2.4GHz = long range, slow, interference</li>\n      <li>5GHz = fast, short range, more channels</li>\n      <li>Channels 1/6/11 = non-overlapping on 2.4GHz</li>\n      <li>n, ac, ax = fast Wi-Fi, support dual-band</li>\n      <li>NFC = tap to pay, RFID = scan to track</li>\n    </ul>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🖼️ Wireless Protocol Table</h3>\n    <p>Visual summary of common wireless technologies and their characteristics:</p>\n    <img src='/2_3.table.png' alt='Wireless Protocols Table' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 1em 0; border: 1px solid #ccc;' />\n  </section>\n</article>"
