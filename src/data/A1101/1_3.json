    "content": "<article>\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔄 CONNECTION METHODS</h3>\n    <h4>🔌 USB Types</h4>\n    <p>USB-C: Reversible, fast data and power (used in modern phones, laptops)</p>\n    <p>microUSB: Older Android devices, small trapezoid shape</p>\n    <p>miniUSB: Bulkier, found in early 2000s cameras and peripherals</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If you see \"reversible connector,\" it's USB-C.</p>\n\n    <h4>⚡ Lightning</h4>\n    <p>Apple-only connector for iPhones, iPads. Reversible, proprietary. Transfers data, power, and audio.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Know that Lightning is Apple-only and looks different from USB-C.</p>\n\n    <h4>🧵 Serial Interfaces</h4>\n    <p>Mostly legacy; used in industrial equipment or specialized tools. RS-232 connector with 9 pins (DB9).</p>\n    <p>Rare on modern mobile devices, but may show up on exam.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If you see \"pin-based connector for configuring switches,\" think serial port.</p>\n\n    <h4>📶 Near-Field Communication (NFC)</h4>\n    <p>Tap-to-pay (Apple Pay, Google Pay). Short-range (4 cm or less). Used for pairing, security access, file transfers.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If it involves a \"tap\" action, it's NFC, not Bluetooth.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔵 Bluetooth</h4>\n    <p>Medium-range wireless (~10m). Used for headsets, speakers, keyboards, car audio. Needs pairing and PIN authentication.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Watch for questions about wireless accessories that stay connected even when phone screen is off.</p>\n\n    <h4>📡 Hotspot</h4>\n    <p>Turns your mobile device into a Wi-Fi router, sharing cellular data with other devices.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If a user is traveling with no Wi-Fi but has LTE, solution = mobile hotspot.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🎧 ACCESSORIES</h3>\n    <h4>🖊️ Touch Pens (Stylus)</h4>\n    <p>Works with digitizers on tablets. Can be passive (no power) or active (powered with Bluetooth features).</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If the screen supports pressure sensitivity or palm rejection, it’s likely an active stylus.</p>\n\n    <h4>🎧 Headsets</h4>\n    <p>Wired: use 3.5mm jack or USB-C. Wireless: Bluetooth connection. Often include built-in microphone.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If audio is distorted, troubleshoot both drivers and Bluetooth pairing.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔊 Speakers</h4>\n    <p>Can be internal (laptop/tablet) or external via Bluetooth/USB. External speakers may need drivers or manual pairing.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Watch for clues in the scenario—Bluetooth needs pairing, USB should work instantly.</p>\n\n    <h4>📷 Webcam</h4>\n    <p>Often built-in, but can connect external webcams via USB. Check privacy settings and device manager if not detected.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Webcam not working after OS reinstall? Reinstall the driver or check permissions.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🧳 DOCKING STATION VS PORT REPLICATOR</h3>\n    <h4>🧼 Docking Station</h4>\n    <p>Expands laptop into a desktop setup (adds display ports, USB, Ethernet, audio). May add functionality (like GPU access or charging).</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If scenario says \"adds new ports,\" it’s a docking station.</p>\n\n    <h4>🔁 Port Replicator</h4>\n    <p>Just duplicates existing ports, nothing new. Common in slim laptops for quick desk connection.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If a user wants \"easier plug-in at desk with no new functionality\" → port replicator.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🎨 TRACKPAD / DRAWING PAD</h3>\n    <p>Trackpad: Built-in pointing device for laptops (uses finger gestures). Drawing pad (graphics tablet): Used with stylus for digital art/design.</p>\n    <p>Connects via USB or Bluetooth, requires specialized software.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Drawing pads are usually used with creators or designers, not typical users.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🎯 FINAL EXAM MASTER TIPS</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>✅ Know the difference between USB-C, microUSB, Lightning.</li>\n      <li>✅ Recognize Bluetooth vs NFC: range, pairing, use cases.</li>\n      <li>✅ Distinguish between dock vs port replicator.</li>\n      <li>✅ Be able to match accessories (stylus, headset, speakers) with their connection methods.</li>\n      <li>✅ Understand how to troubleshoot audio/video input/output devices.</li>\n      <li>✅ Don’t ignore legacy ports like serial—even if rare, they show up on the test!</li>\n    </ul>\n  </section>\n</article>"
