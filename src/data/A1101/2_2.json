Used in larger or business networks.</p>\n    <h4>▪️ Unmanaged Switch</h4>\n    <p>Plug-and-play, no configuration. Used in homes or small offices.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Switches = Layer 2, unless it's a Layer 3 switch, which routes too.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📶 Access Points</h3>\n    <p>Extends Wi-Fi coverage. Acts as a bridge between wired and wireless.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Not the same as a router, but often built-in.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🧵 Patch Panel</h3>\n    <p>Central point for cable organization. No intelligence—just physical connection points.</p>\n    <p>Used in network racks for easy cable management.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Think of it as the network’s “phonebook” for cables.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔥 Firewall</h3>\n    <p>Filters incoming/outgoing traffic based on rules. Can be software or hardware. Protects against unauthorized access.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Look for scenarios involving port blocking, IP filtering, or packet inspection.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>⚡ Power over Ethernet (PoE)</h3>\n    <p>Sends power + data through Ethernet cable.</p>\n    <h4>▪️ Injectors</h4>\n    <p>Add power to Ethernet lines for non-PoE switches.</p>\n    <h4>▪️ PoE Switch</h4>\n    <p>Built-in power delivery, no injector needed.</p>\n    <h4>▪️ PoE Standards</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>IEEE 802.3af (PoE) = 15.4W</li>\n      <li>IEEE 802.3at (PoE+) = 25.5W</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Used for powering APs, IP cameras, VoIP phones.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🧩 Hub</h3>\n    <p>Repeats all network traffic to all ports (no intelligence). Causes network collisions (uses CSMA/CD).</p>\n    <p>Obsolete, replaced by switches.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Exam Tip:</strong> If it floods traffic → it’s a hub, not a switch.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>📡 Cable Modem</h3>\n    <p>Connects to ISP via coaxial cable. Converts signal for Internet use (DOCSIS standard).</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Common in home internet setups.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>☎️ DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)</h3>\n    <p>Uses telephone lines for internet. Slower than cable/fiber.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Often found in rural areas.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🔦 ONT (Optical Network Terminal)</h3>\n    <p>Device that converts fiber signals to Ethernet. Used in FTTH (Fiber to the Home) installations.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> If the scenario includes fiber, look for ONT.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>💻 NIC (Network Interface Card)</h3>\n    <p>Hardware that connects a device to a network. Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Found inside computers, printers, etc.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>🧠 SDN (Software-Defined Networking)</h3>\n    <p>Controls network via software, not hardware. Used in cloud networks and datacenters.</p>\n    <p>Centralized controller dynamically manages traffic.</p>\n    <p>🧠 <strong>Tip:</strong> Flexible, programmable—modern enterprise networks love SDN.</p>\n  </section>\n\n  <section>\n    <h3>✅ Final Tips</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Switch = efficient, Hub = dumb</li>\n      <li>Router = connects networks, AP = connects devices to Wi-Fi</li>\n      <li>Patch panel = organizes cables, PoE = powers devices</li>\n      <li>Know which protocols/services each hardware type supports!</li>\n    </ul>\n  </section>\n</article>"
