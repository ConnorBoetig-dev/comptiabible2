    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Incorrect Cable</h2>\n  <p>Using the wrong type of cable for a specific connection can cause communication problems or complete failure.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using a Cat5 cable instead of Cat6 for higher-speed connections.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌐 Single Mode vs. Multimode</h2>\n  <p>Single-mode fiber is used for long-distance communication and has a small core size. Multimode fiber has a larger core and is used for shorter distances.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using single-mode fiber for inter-building connections and multimode for shorter, intra-building links.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔌 Category 5/6/7/8 Cables</h2>\n  <p>The category of cable (e.g., Cat5, Cat6) determines the bandwidth and distance limitations. Higher categories (like Cat7, Cat8) support faster speeds over longer distances.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using Cat5 for older network setups or Cat6/Cat6a for modern networks to achieve gigabit speeds.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛠️ Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) vs. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)</h2>\n  <p>STP cables have shielding to protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI), while UTP cables don’t.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using STP in environments with high interference or UTP for typical office setups where interference is low.</p>\n\n  <h2>🧳 Signal Degradation</h2>\n  <p>Signal degradation happens over distance as the signal weakens, leading to slower speeds or loss of communication.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring that cable runs don’t exceed the recommended distances for Cat5/Cat6 cables (100 meters for Cat5e).</p>\n\n  <h2>📉 Crosstalk</h2>\n  <p>Crosstalk is the interference caused by signal leakage between cables, leading to communication problems.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring that cables are properly twisted or shielded to prevent this issue.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌀 Interference</h2>\n  <p>External sources like motors, fluorescent lights, or other electronics can cause interference in the network cables, impacting signal integrity.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using shielded cables (STP) in areas with high electromagnetic interference.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔽 Attenuation</h2>\n  <p>Attenuation refers to the signal loss as it travels through the cable. Higher frequency signals are more prone to attenuation.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring the correct cable length is used to avoid excessive signal loss.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛠️ Improper Termination</h2>\n  <p>Improper termination of cables results in communication failure. This happens when connectors at the ends of cables are not installed correctly.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Properly crimping the ends of Ethernet cables to ensure the correct alignment of pins.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔄 Transmitter (TX)/Receiver (RX) Transposed</h2>\n  <p>When the TX (transmitter) and RX (receiver) wires in a cable are swapped, data can’t be transmitted correctly.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring correct pinout when connecting cables to switches, routers, or network cards.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Interface Issues</h2>\n  <h3>📈 Increasing Interface Counters</h3>\n  <p>Increasing interface counters can indicate network performance problems, like high traffic or collisions.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking network device interfaces for increased error or packet drop counters to identify issues such as network congestion or faulty cables.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌀 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)</h3>\n  <p>A CRC error indicates a failure in data transmission, often due to bad cables, interference, or faulty hardware.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Troubleshooting CRC errors in Ethernet frames, which could indicate issues with cables or poor connections.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Hardware Issues</h2>\n  <h3>⚡ Power over Ethernet (PoE)</h3>\n  <p>Power over Ethernet (PoE) allows both power and data to be transmitted through a single Ethernet cable. Issues can arise if the PoE budget is exceeded, if the wrong PoE standard is used, or if the connected devices require more power than the cable can supply.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring the PoE power budget is not exceeded when connecting devices like IP phones or access points. Also, checking for compatibility with standards like IEEE 802.3af (PoE) and 802.3at (PoE+).</p>\n\n  <h3>🔋 Power Budget Exceeded</h3>\n  <p>When PoE power exceeds the available power budget, the device won’t function properly or may shut down.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking the total wattage required by all devices and ensuring the network switch can provide enough power to all connected devices.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔌 Incorrect Standard</h3>\n  <p>The wrong PoE standard can cause devices to not receive enough power or not function properly.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring devices are using the correct PoE standard. For example, 802.3af may not provide enough power for certain devices like cameras that require 802.3at.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖧 Transceivers</h3>\n  <p>Transceiver mismatch or poor signal strength can cause communication problems. A mismatch between transceiver types (e.g., SFP+ vs. SFP) can prevent devices from connecting.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking that the transceivers on both sides of the connection match (e.g., SFP for gigabit connections and SFP+ for 10-gigabit).</p>\n\n  <h3>🔋 Signal Strength</h3>\n  <p>Weak signal strength can cause poor network performance, especially in wireless or fiber connections.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring that network cables are of the correct type and length to avoid signal loss, and checking wireless devices for sufficient signal strength.</p>\n</article>"
