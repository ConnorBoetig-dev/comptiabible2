    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>⏱️ Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</h2>\n  <p>RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It tells you how far back in time your data can be restored after a disaster.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your RPO is 4 hours, you can afford to lose up to 4 hours' worth of data.</p>\n\n  <h2>⏳ Recovery Time Objective (RTO)</h2>\n  <p>RTO is the maximum amount of time that an application or service can be unavailable after a disaster. It determines how quickly the service must be restored to avoid significant business impact.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your RTO is 1 hour, your system must be back online within 1 hour of a failure.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔧 Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)</h2>\n  <p>MTTR is the average time it takes to repair a system after a failure occurs, from when the issue is first detected to the time it’s fixed and operational again.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your MTTR is 2 hours, then after a failure, it should take about 2 hours to get things back up and running.</p>\n\n  <h2>🕰️ Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</h2>\n  <p>MTBF is the average time between failures of a system or component. It’s a reliability measure used to predict when a system might fail.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the MTBF is 10,000 hours, the system is expected to fail approximately every 10,000 hours of operation.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏢 Disaster Recovery (DR) Sites</h2>\n  <h3>🧊 Cold Site</h3>\n  <p>A cold site is a backup site that has the basic infrastructure for a disaster recovery plan but no active equipment or data. It’s inexpensive but requires time to set up systems and restore services.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Suitable for organizations with flexible recovery time objectives.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌡️ Warm Site</h3>\n  <p>A warm site has some equipment and possibly data available but requires additional configuration or setup to bring it fully online after a disaster. It is a balance between cost and recovery speed.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Often used by companies needing a moderate level of preparedness.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔥 Hot Site</h3>\n  <p>A hot site is a fully operational backup site that can immediately take over operations in the event of a disaster. It typically mirrors the primary site’s infrastructure and data in real-time.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used by organizations that require minimal downtime and near-instantaneous recovery.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 High-Availability Approaches</h2>\n  <h3>🔁 Active-Active</h3>\n  <p>An active-active setup means that two or more data centers are actively running and processing traffic at the same time. In the event of a failure, traffic is automatically redirected to the remaining active sites with no downtime.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Essential for mission-critical systems that cannot afford downtime.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔀 Active-Passive</h3>\n  <p>In an active-passive setup, one data center is actively handling traffic while the other is on standby, ready to take over in case the active site fails. There is typically some downtime during the failover process.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Often used in environments where some downtime is acceptable but recovery must still be fast.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Testing</h2>\n  <h3>🧑‍🏫 Tabletop Exercises</h3>\n  <p>Tabletop exercises are discussion-based sessions where team members walk through disaster recovery scenarios to assess the organization’s preparedness and response strategies. These are typically done in a low-pressure, controlled environment.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Testing and refining DR plans without actually simulating the disaster.</p>\n\n  <h3>🧪 Validation Tests</h3>\n  <p>Validation tests involve actual tests or drills that simulate real-world disaster scenarios to verify that the recovery plan works as expected. This is a more hands-on approach than tabletop exercises.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Testing the recovery infrastructure in a real or simulated environment to ensure readiness.</p>\n</article>"
