    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🏢 Locations</h2>\n  <h3>Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF)</h3>\n  <p>An IDF is a distribution point for telecommunications wiring in a network, typically located closer to end devices. It connects to the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) to distribute signals to devices.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Found in larger buildings or campuses where the network is extended.</p>\n\n  <h3>Main Distribution Frame (MDF)</h3>\n  <p>The MDF is the primary point where the network’s external connections (e.g., internet, WAN) are linked to internal network components. It typically houses routers, switches, and servers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Usually located in the data center or main network room.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Rack Size</h2>\n  <h3>Rack Size</h3>\n  <p>Racks are used to mount networking equipment such as servers, switches, and routers. The size of the rack is important to ensure the proper installation and airflow for cooling.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Standard racks are usually 19 inches wide, but depth can vary.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Port-Side Exhaust/Intake</h2>\n  <h3>Port-Side Exhaust/Intake</h3>\n  <p>Proper airflow is crucial to ensure that devices like switches and routers are not overheated. Ports should be aligned for proper air intake and exhaust to maintain optimal operating temperatures.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Proper airflow configuration prevents overheating of equipment.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧑‍🔧 Lockable</h2>\n  <h3>Lockable</h3>\n  <p>The installation location should have secure, lockable racks or cabinets to prevent unauthorized access to networking equipment and physical tampering with the hardware.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Security feature in data centers and office installations.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Power</h2>\n  <h3>🔋 Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)</h3>\n  <p>A UPS provides backup power to network equipment in case of power outages, ensuring that equipment continues to run and that data is not lost. It also protects against voltage fluctuations.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in server rooms and critical infrastructure to prevent downtime during power outages.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔌 Power Distribution Unit (PDU)</h3>\n  <p>A PDU is used to distribute electrical power to multiple devices, typically within a data center. It ensures the proper distribution of power to all connected equipment.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Found in data centers, often used to manage large numbers of servers.</p>\n\n  <h3>⚡ Power Load</h3>\n  <p>Power load refers to the amount of electrical power required to run all devices connected to a PDU or UPS. It's important to balance the power load to prevent overloads.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring that the devices do not exceed the power capacity to prevent failure.</p>\n\n  <h3>⚡ Voltage</h3>\n  <p>Voltage refers to the amount of electrical force used to push current through the equipment. The correct voltage is necessary to ensure the safe and effective operation of devices.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensure equipment is powered correctly based on manufacturer specifications.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌡️ Environmental Factors</h2>\n  <h3>🌬️ Humidity</h3>\n  <p>Humidity can have a significant impact on the functioning of network equipment. Too much humidity can lead to corrosion, while too little can lead to static electricity and equipment failure.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Controlled environments with humidity monitoring are essential in data centers.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔥 Fire Suppression</h3>\n  <p>Fire suppression systems are designed to prevent or put out fires that may occur in server rooms or network facilities. These systems typically use clean agents or gas systems instead of water to avoid damaging sensitive equipment.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Essential in data centers or server rooms where the risk of fire is significant.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌡️ Temperature</h3>\n  <p>Maintaining a stable temperature is crucial for network equipment to function correctly. Excessive heat can damage components, while too cold can cause condensation.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Climate control systems are implemented to keep temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) in server rooms.</p>\n</article>"
