    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🌐 Static Routing</h2>\n  <p>Static routing involves manually configuring the routes that data takes to travel across a network. These routes are fixed and do not change unless manually updated by the network administrator.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Simple, no overhead from routing protocols.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> Not scalable and requires manual intervention for changes.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🚀 Dynamic Routing</h2>\n  <p>Dynamic routing uses routing protocols to automatically adjust the paths that data takes based on real-time network conditions (such as link failures). These protocols discover optimal paths dynamically.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Scalable and adaptable to network changes.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> More complex and may have overhead from protocol exchanges.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛰️ Routing Protocols</h2>\n  <h3>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</h3>\n  <p>BGP is a path vector protocol used for routing between autonomous systems (AS) on the internet. It's the protocol that powers inter-domain routing (between different networks).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Internet routing.</p>\n\n  <h3>Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)</h3>\n  <p>EIGRP is an advanced distance-vector protocol that combines the advantages of both link-state and distance-vector routing protocols. It is mainly used within a single AS.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Cisco networks, where ease of configuration is required.</p>\n\n  <h3>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</h3>\n  <p>OSPF is a link-state routing protocol used for routing within an AS. It builds a map of the network and dynamically determines the best path to a destination.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Large enterprise networks due to its scalability and efficiency.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛠️ Route Selection Criteria</h2>\n  <h3>Administrative Distance</h3>\n  <p>Administrative distance is a value used to rate the trustworthiness of a routing protocol. Lower values indicate higher trust.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> OSPF has an administrative distance of 110, while EIGRP has 90 (more trusted).</p>\n\n  <h3>Prefix Length</h3>\n  <p>The prefix length (also known as subnet mask) determines the number of bits used for the network portion of an IP address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> To create subnets and define the network range for routing decisions.</p>\n\n  <h3>Metric</h3>\n  <p>A metric is a value used by routing protocols to determine the \"cost\" of a route. Lower metrics are preferred as they indicate a better or shorter route.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> In OSPF, metrics are based on link speed; in EIGRP, metrics are based on bandwidth and delay.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Address Translation</h2>\n  <h3>🔄 Network Address Translation (NAT)</h3>\n  <p>NAT is used to map private IP addresses to a public IP address for communication over the internet. This allows multiple devices to share a single public IP address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Home routers or corporate networks for secure internet access.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 Port Address Translation (PAT)</h3>\n  <p>PAT, also known as \"overloading,\" allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address, but distinguishes between devices using port numbers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Typically used in home and small business routers.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)</h3>\n  <p>FHRP ensures that if a router goes down, another router can take its place and continue routing traffic, ensuring network reliability and availability.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> In critical network environments for failover and redundancy.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖥️ Virtual IP (VIP)</h3>\n  <p>A virtual IP address is an IP address that is not tied to a specific physical interface. It can be assigned to multiple devices and moved between them for high availability.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Load balancing, failover, and high-availability configurations.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖧 Subinterfaces</h3>\n  <p>Subinterfaces allow a single physical network interface to act as multiple logical interfaces, each with its own IP address and subnet. This is useful for VLANs and routing between networks.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in routers to manage multiple VLANs or IP subnets over a single physical link.</p>\n</article>"
