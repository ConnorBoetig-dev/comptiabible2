This type of VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection between two sites, allowing resources on both networks to be accessible.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Connecting branch offices to a corporate headquarters network.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Client-to-Site VPN</h2>\n  <p>Client-to-Site VPN (also called remote access VPN) allows individual users to connect securely to a remote network from their devices (laptop, smartphone, etc.). It encrypts traffic between the client device and the VPN server.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Secure remote access for employees working from home.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🚫 Clientless VPN</h2>\n  <p>Clientless VPN provides secure access to web-based applications via a browser, without requiring the installation of VPN client software on the user’s device.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Accessing enterprise applications remotely without needing to install software on the device.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Split Tunnel vs. Full Tunnel</h2>\n  <h3>Split Tunnel</h3>\n  <p>Allows the user to access the internet directly while only routing the private network traffic through the VPN.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Efficient, but can potentially expose some traffic to security risks.</p>\n  <h3>Full Tunnel</h3>\n  <p>Routes all traffic (including internet access) through the VPN, providing a more secure solution, but it may slow down the user’s internet connection.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Best for securing all traffic to ensure no data leaks.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔐 Connection Methods</h2>\n  <h3>💻 SSH (Secure Shell)</h3>\n  <p>SSH is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely connect and manage network devices (like routers and switches) over an unsecured network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Accessing and managing remote network devices securely, especially in headless environments (devices without a display).</p>\n\n  <h3>🎛️ Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>\n  <p>GUI allows users to manage network devices or systems using graphical controls such as buttons, windows, and menus. It’s often considered user-friendly compared to command-line interfaces.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Managing network devices or systems where ease of use is a priority over speed or automation.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖥️ API (Application Programming Interface)</h3>\n  <p>API allows software applications to interact with each other, typically used for automating tasks or integrating different systems. For network management, APIs can be used to control and configure network devices programmatically.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Automating repetitive tasks and integrating network management with other IT tools.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖱️ Console</h3>\n  <p>Console refers to accessing a device directly via a serial connection, often through a console cable or a terminal emulation software (like PuTTY). It’s typically used when no network connection is available.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Initial configuration or recovery of network devices when remote access is not possible.</p>\n\n  <h3>💻 Jump Box/Host</h3>\n  <p>Jump Box/Host is a device used to access and manage other devices in a network, typically located in a demilitarized zone (DMZ). It acts as a secure entry point for administrators.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used for secure administrative access to networks, often as a first step for managing devices in secured or isolated environments.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 In-band vs. Out-of-band Management</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 In-band Management</h3>\n  <p>In-band Management refers to managing devices over the same network used for regular traffic. It typically involves accessing network devices via SSH, GUI, or APIs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Common in many modern networks, but can be risky if the network becomes unavailable.</p>\n\n  <h3>🚪 Out-of-band Management</h3>\n  <p>Out-of-band Management provides access to devices through a dedicated management channel that is separate from the main data network. This method allows administrators to access devices even if the main network is down.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used for critical devices where access must be guaranteed even in the event of network failure.</p>\n</article>"
