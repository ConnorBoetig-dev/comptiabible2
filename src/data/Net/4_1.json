    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔒 Encryption</h2>\n  <h3>Data in Transit</h3>\n  <p>Encryption of data while it’s moving across the network prevents unauthorized parties from intercepting and reading the information.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Secures data transfers, like credit card information during online purchases, via protocols like HTTPS or SSL/TLS.</p>\n  <h3>Data at Rest</h3>\n  <p>Encrypting data that is stored, such as on a server or a database, protects it in case of theft or unauthorized access.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Protects sensitive data on hard drives, cloud storage, and backup systems.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Certificates</h2>\n  <h3>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h3>\n  <p>PKI is a framework that manages digital keys and certificates used for secure communication. It uses public and private key pairs to encrypt and decrypt data.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensures secure communication for online transactions and email encryption.</p>\n  <h3>Self-signed</h3>\n  <p>A self-signed certificate is one that is signed by the entity that created it, rather than a trusted certificate authority (CA).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in test environments or internal applications where cost is a consideration, but security is not a major concern.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>👥 Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>\n  <h3>Authentication</h3>\n  <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system before granting access to a resource.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Username and password are the most common methods for user authentication.</p>\n  <h3>Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</h3>\n  <p>MFA requires multiple forms of identification, such as something you know (password), have (smartphone/token), or are (biometric).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access.</p>\n  <h3>Single Sign-On (SSO)</h3>\n  <p>SSO allows users to access multiple systems with one set of credentials.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in enterprises to streamline login across multiple apps.</p>\n  <h3>RADIUS</h3>\n  <p>RADIUS is a protocol that provides centralized AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) management.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Wi-Fi and VPN access control.</p>\n  <h3>LDAP</h3>\n  <p>LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage directory services like Active Directory.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Centralized authentication in organizations.</p>\n  <h3>SAML</h3>\n  <p>SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data, often used in SSO.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Federated identity systems across web services.</p>\n  <h3>TACACS+</h3>\n  <p>A protocol used for remote authentication and access control, similar to RADIUS but more secure.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Network device authentication and authorization.</p>\n  <h3>Time-based Authentication</h3>\n  <p>Limits access based on time or schedules to enforce login restrictions.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Restrict access during off-hours or maintenance windows.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛡️ Authorization</h2>\n  <h3>⚖️ Least Privilege</h3>\n  <p>Users and systems only get access needed to do their job.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Reduces attack surface.</p>\n  <h3>🛑 Role-based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>\n  <p>Permissions are granted based on user roles rather than individual identities.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Simplifies permission management.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌍 Geofencing</h2>\n  <p>Creates a virtual boundary around a geographic area using GPS or RFID.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Enforces security policies based on user location.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔒 Physical Security</h2>\n  <h3>📷 Cameras</h3>\n  <p>Used for surveillance and monitoring secure locations.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> CCTV in data centers or entrances.</p>\n  <h3>🔒 Locks</h3>\n  <p>Secure doors or cabinets to prevent unauthorized physical access.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Server racks or secure rooms.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧩 Deception Technologies</h2>\n  <h3>🍯 Honeypot</h3>\n  <p>Fake system used to lure attackers and analyze their behavior.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Diverts attacks from real systems.</p>\n  <h3>🏚️ Honeynet</h3>\n  <p>A full network of honeypots to simulate an enterprise network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Researching attack patterns.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📚 Common Security Terminology</h2>\n  <h3>⚖️ Risk</h3>\n  <p>Likelihood x impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.</p>\n  <h3>🛠️ Vulnerability</h3>\n  <p>A flaw that can be exploited by a threat actor.</p>\n  <h3>💣 Exploit</h3>\n  <p>Code or technique used to leverage a vulnerability.</p>\n  <h3>⚔️ Threat</h3>\n  <p>Any event or actor capable of causing harm.</p>\n  <h3>🔐 CIA Triad</h3>\n  <p>Confidentiality: Restrict access to data.</p>\n  <p>Integrity: Ensure data is accurate and untampered.</p>\n  <p>Availability: Ensure data is accessible when needed.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Audits and Regulatory Compliance</h2>\n  <h3>🌍 Data Locality</h3>\n  <p>Where data resides physically, which may be regulated by law.</p>\n  <h3>💳 PCI DSS</h3>\n  <p>Security standards for organizations handling credit card data.</p>\n  <h3>🛡️ GDPR</h3>\n  <p>European Union regulation on personal data protection.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 Network Segmentation Enforcement</h2>\n  <h3>🌍 IoT & IIoT</h3>\n  <p>Securing smart and industrial connected devices.</p>\n  <h3>⚙️ SCADA, ICS, OT</h3>\n  <p>Systems for controlling industrial processes must be secured from cyber threats.</p>\n  <h3>🚶 Guest Networks</h3>\n  <p>Provide isolated access for visitors.</p>\n  <h3>📱 BYOD</h3>\n  <p>Enabling personal devices while maintaining corporate security controls.</p>\n</article>"
