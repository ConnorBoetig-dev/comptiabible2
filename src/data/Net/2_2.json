    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🏠 VLAN Database</h2>\n  <p>The VLAN database is used to store information about all VLANs configured on a network switch. This includes VLAN names, IDs, and associated ports.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)</h2>\n  <p>An SVI is a virtual interface associated with a VLAN on a switch that allows for routing between VLANs (inter-VLAN routing). Each VLAN on a switch can have an SVI that acts as the default gateway for devices in that VLAN.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛠️ Interface Configuration</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 Native VLAN</h3>\n  <p>The native VLAN is the VLAN assigned to untagged frames on a trunk link. If a switch receives a frame without a VLAN tag, it associates the frame with the native VLAN.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Typically, VLAN 1 is the native VLAN, but it can be changed for security reasons.</p>\n\n  <h3>📞 Voice VLAN</h3>\n  <p>A voice VLAN is used specifically for VoIP traffic to ensure that voice data is prioritized over other types of data on the network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> When implementing VoIP systems, a separate VLAN helps ensure good call quality by segregating voice traffic.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Switching Features</h2>\n  <h3>🏷️ 802.1Q Tagging</h3>\n  <p>802.1Q is a VLAN tagging standard that adds a VLAN identifier (VLAN ID) to Ethernet frames. This allows for multiple VLANs to traverse the same network link (trunk link), making it possible for switches to distinguish between VLANs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used on trunk links between switches and routers.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔗 Link Aggregation</h3>\n  <p>Link aggregation combines multiple physical network connections into a single logical connection to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy. This can be achieved using protocols like LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> In high-traffic environments where additional bandwidth and fault tolerance are needed.</p>\n\n  <h3>🚀 Speed</h3>\n  <p>Speed refers to the rate at which data is transmitted across a network. Ethernet speeds commonly range from 10 Mbps to 100 Gbps depending on the type of network and devices used.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 Duplex</h3>\n  <p>Duplex refers to the ability of a network link to send and receive data.</p>\n  <p><strong>Half-duplex:</strong> Data can flow in one direction at a time.</p>\n  <p><strong>Full-duplex:</strong> Data can flow in both directions simultaneously, improving performance.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 Spanning Tree</h2>\n  <h3>🌱 Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)</h3>\n  <p>STP is used in Ethernet networks to prevent loops in network topologies. It automatically detects and disables redundant paths while allowing network traffic to flow efficiently.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensures a loop-free network, especially in large, redundant network designs.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>⚙️ Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)</h2>\n  <h3>🧑‍💻 Jumbo Frames</h3>\n  <p>Jumbo frames are Ethernet frames that are larger than the standard 1500 bytes (up to 9000 bytes or more). These larger frames can increase throughput and reduce CPU overhead in high-performance networks.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Often used in data center environments or networks handling large amounts of data.</p>\n</article>"
