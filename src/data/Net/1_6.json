    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔗 Mesh</h2>\n  <p>A network topology where each device is connected to every other device, offering high redundancy and reliability. This topology is often used in critical, high-availability systems.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Highly resilient to failures.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> Expensive and complex to set up and maintain.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Hybrid</h2>\n  <p>A combination of two or more network topologies, designed to combine the benefits of different setups based on specific needs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Example:</strong> A hybrid network might combine a star topology in one area and a mesh in another, depending on the criticality of connections.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>⭐ Star/Hub and Spoke</h2>\n  <p>A topology where all devices are connected to a central hub or switch.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Centralized management and easy to scale.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> The central hub is a single point of failure.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🍃 Spine and Leaf</h2>\n  <p>A modern data center network architecture where spine switches are connected to leaf switches. Leaf switches connect to devices, while spine switches connect leaf switches together.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Efficient routing, low latency, and high scalability in data centers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> Can be complex to design for large networks.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>↔️ Point to Point</h2>\n  <p>A simple topology where two devices are directly connected to each other with a dedicated link.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Reliable and easy to manage.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> Limited scalability, as each new connection requires a dedicated link.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏛️ Three-Tier Hierarchical Model</h2>\n  <p><strong>Core:</strong> The backbone layer where high-speed switching happens, connecting various distribution and access layers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Responsible for routing and policy-based control of traffic.</p>\n  <p><strong>Access:</strong> Where end devices like computers and printers are connected.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌍 Traffic Flows</h2>\n  <h3>⬇️ North-South</h3>\n  <p>Refers to data flow between end-user devices (like computers) and the data center or cloud. This is the traditional \"client-server\" communication model.</p>\n  <h3>↔️ East-West</h3>\n  <p>Refers to data flow within the data center or between servers. This is often higher-volume traffic within a network, such as between application servers or database clusters.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏢 Collapsed Core</h2>\n  <p>A simplified version of the three-tier model, where the core and distribution layers are merged into a single layer. This is commonly used in smaller networks or environments where simplicity is prioritized.</p>\n  <p><strong>Pro:</strong> Simplified network architecture and easier management.</p>\n  <p><strong>Con:</strong> Less scalability compared to a full three-tier model.</p>\n</article>"
