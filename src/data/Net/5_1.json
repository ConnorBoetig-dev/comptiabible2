    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>📋 Gather Information</h2>\n  <p>Collect relevant data from the user, logs, and network devices to understand the scope of the problem.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Gathering system logs, error messages, and asking the user about recent changes or issues.</p>\n\n  <h2>❓ Question Users</h2>\n  <p>Engage the user to understand the symptoms they’re experiencing and get as much detail as possible.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Asking the user specific questions to clarify the issue, such as \"When did this problem start?\" or \"What changed recently?\"</p>\n\n  <h2>📊 Identify Symptoms</h2>\n  <p>Identify the exact symptoms of the issue, such as connectivity problems, slow performance, or service interruptions.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Pinpointing if it's a network issue, application issue, or hardware fault.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔄 Determine if Anything Has Changed</h2>\n  <p>Find out if any recent changes were made to the system or network that could be causing the issue.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Asking, \"Did you install any software, update configurations, or change network settings recently?\"</p>\n\n  <h2>🔄 Duplicate the Problem, If Possible</h2>\n  <p>Reproduce the issue to better understand it and confirm that it's happening.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Trying to replicate the issue yourself on the same system or network.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛠️ Approach Multiple Problems Individually</h2>\n  <p>Avoid assuming the issue is due to one cause, and tackle each potential issue one at a time.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Troubleshooting individual parts of the network like routers, switches, or endpoints.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧠 Establish a Theory of Probable Cause</h2>\n  <h3>❗ Question the Obvious</h3>\n  <p>It’s often easy to overlook the most basic causes of a problem, so questioning the obvious first is important.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking if cables are connected, if devices are powered on, or if software/services are running.</p>\n\n  <h3>💭 Consider Multiple Approaches</h3>\n  <p>Consider various troubleshooting approaches based on the scenario.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Using a top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top approach, or divide and conquer to narrow down the issue.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌐 Top-to-Bottom/Bottom-to-Top OSI Model</h3>\n  <p>Troubleshoot by applying the OSI model, starting from the physical layer (bottom-to-top) or application layer (top-to-bottom).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> For example, checking cables (Physical Layer) first, or starting from the application (top) layer to see if the issue is there.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔀 Divide and Conquer</h3>\n  <p>Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, and focus on one piece at a time to find the root cause.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> If multiple issues appear, isolate each component (network, hardware, software) and test them individually.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧪 Test the Theory to Determine the Cause</h2>\n  <h3>✅ If Theory Is Confirmed, Determine Next Steps to Resolve Problem</h3>\n  <p>Once you’ve confirmed your theory, create a plan of action to resolve the issue and prevent it from happening again.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> If you’ve confirmed that a specific faulty cable is the issue, replace it and test the system.</p>\n\n  <h3>❌ If Theory Is Not Confirmed, Establish a New Theory or Escalate</h3>\n  <p>If your initial theory doesn't resolve the problem, form a new hypothesis and continue testing. If you reach a point where you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to a higher level of support.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> If replacing the cable doesn't fix the issue, investigate other potential causes, such as device misconfigurations, and escalate to a senior technician if necessary.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Identify Potential Effects</h2>\n  <p>Develop a clear plan of action to resolve the issue. This plan should identify the cause of the problem, outline the steps to fix it, and include any possible side effects of implementing the solution.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Deciding to restart a router to fix connectivity issues and considering any temporary disruptions that may occur when doing so.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🚀 Implement the Solution or Escalate as Necessary</h2>\n  <p>Once you have a solution, implement it, or if the issue is beyond your scope or expertise, escalate it to a higher level or team for resolution.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Applying a software patch to fix a vulnerability or escalating the issue to the network administrator if it requires reconfiguring the firewall.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>✅ Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventive Measures if Applicable</h2>\n  <p>After implementing the solution, verify that the system is functioning correctly and take any preventive measures to avoid future issues.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Running tests to ensure the network is fully functional, setting up alerts for future issues, and performing additional hardening to prevent similar issues.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Document Findings, Actions, Outcomes, and Lessons Learned Throughout the Process</h2>\n  <p>Document everything, including the findings, the actions you took, the results, and any lessons learned. This will help with future troubleshooting efforts and improve the overall process.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Recording the issue in a knowledge base for future reference or providing a report with detailed steps to senior staff.</p>\n</article>"
