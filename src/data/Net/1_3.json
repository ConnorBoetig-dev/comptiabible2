The most common type of cloud environment.</p>\n\n  <h3>🏠 Private</h3>\n  <p>Resources are used exclusively by one organization. Can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 Hybrid</h3>\n  <p>A combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them for greater flexibility.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛠️ Service Models</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>\n  <p>Software applications hosted in the cloud and accessed through a web browser (e.g., Gmail, Office 365).</p>\n\n  <h3>🖥️ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>\n  <p>Cloud services that provide computing resources like servers, storage, and networking—clients manage the operating system and applications (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs).</p>\n\n  <h3>🏗️ Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>\n  <p>Cloud-based development platforms where developers can build, test, and deploy applications without managing the underlying hardware or software layers (e.g., Google App Engine, Azure App Service).</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📈 Scalability</h2>\n  <p>The ability of a cloud environment to handle increased workloads by expanding resources (e.g., more VMs or storage) without affecting performance.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Elasticity</h2>\n  <p>The ability of cloud resources to automatically scale up or down in response to workload demands, ensuring efficient use of resources.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏢 Multitenancy</h2>\n  <p>A cloud architecture where multiple customers (tenants) share the same infrastructure but maintain isolated resources. The same physical resources serve multiple customers.</p>\n</article>"
