    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔒 Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)</h2>\n  <p>APIPA is a feature that assigns a private IP address automatically when a device is unable to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. This address falls within the 169.254.x.x range, which is used for local network communication without internet access.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in small or isolated networks where DHCP is unavailable.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 RFC1918</h2>\n  <p>RFC1918 defines the address ranges reserved for private use on local networks. These addresses cannot be routed over the internet, helping to prevent IP address conflicts and enhance network security.</p>\n  <p><strong>Private IP Address Ranges (RFC1918):</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (Class A)</li>\n    <li>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (Class B)</li>\n    <li>192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (Class C)</li>\n  </ul>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Loopback/localhost</h2>\n  <p>The loopback address (typically 127.0.0.1) is used by a computer to communicate with itself, often used for testing and network diagnostics.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> \"ping 127.0.0.1\" is used to check if the local networking stack is working.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔀 Subnetting</h2>\n  <h3>📏 Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM)</h3>\n  <p>VLSM allows the network administrator to use subnet masks of different lengths within the same network, providing more flexibility in IP address allocation. This is particularly useful for optimizing IP address usage across various subnets.</p>\n  <h3>🔄 Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR)</h3>\n  <p>CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing IP packets. CIDR notation simplifies the traditional IP address and subnet mask format into a format like 192.168.0.0/24, where /24 indicates the number of bits used for the network portion of the address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Allows more efficient IP address allocation and helps prevent wastage of IP addresses.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏷️ IPv4 Address Classes</h2>\n  <h3>🌍 Class A</h3>\n  <p>Class A addresses are used for very large networks and have a range of 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255, with a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0.</p>\n  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Ideal for large organizations, ISPs, and major enterprises that require a vast number of IP addresses.</p>\n  <h3>🌐 Class B</h3>\n  <p>Class B addresses range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.0.0.</p>\n  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Suitable for medium-sized networks and large businesses with a large number of devices.</p>\n  <h3>💻 Class C</h3>\n  <p>Class C addresses range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255, with a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.</p>\n  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Commonly used for small networks and businesses, as it supports up to 254 devices per subnet.</p>\n  <h3>📡 Class D</h3>\n  <p>Class D addresses range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, and are used for multicast communication.</p>\n  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> For sending messages to multiple receivers simultaneously (e.g., streaming, conferencing).</p>\n  <h3>🧑‍💻 Class E</h3>\n  <p>Class E addresses range from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 and are reserved for future use or experimental purposes. These addresses are not typically used for public or private networks.</p>\n  <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Reserved for research and development.</p>\n</article>"
