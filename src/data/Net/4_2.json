    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🚫 Denial-of-Service (DoS)/Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)</h2>\n  <p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks aim to make a network or service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Overloading a website’s server with traffic to make it crash.</p>\n  <p>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks involve multiple systems working together to launch a coordinated attack, making it harder to defend against.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Botnets are often used in DDoS attacks to flood a target network with massive traffic.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 VLAN Hopping</h2>\n  <p>VLAN Hopping allows attackers to send traffic between VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) that should be isolated from each other. This is typically done by exploiting misconfigurations.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Exploiting a switch’s vulnerability to bridge traffic from one VLAN to another, gaining access to sensitive data.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏷️ MAC Flooding</h2>\n  <p>MAC Flooding involves overwhelming a switch with fake MAC addresses, causing it to fail and revert to behaving like a hub. This allows attackers to intercept network traffic.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> To bypass a switch’s security and potentially sniff traffic.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔍 ARP Poisoning & 👀 ARP Spoofing</h2>\n  <p>ARP Poisoning (or ARP Spoofing) involves sending fake ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Enables man-in-the-middle attacks or disrupts communication between devices.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧠 DNS Poisoning & 🔄 DNS Spoofing</h2>\n  <p>DNS Poisoning involves corrupting the DNS cache to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate site to a malicious one.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Redirecting users to fake websites to collect personal data or spread malware.</p>\n  <p>DNS Spoofing tricks a DNS server into resolving a domain to the wrong IP address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Misleading users to phishing or malicious servers.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🚨 Rogue Devices and Services</h2>\n  <h3>🔌 Rogue DHCP Server</h3>\n  <p>Issues unauthorized IP addresses, potentially disrupting network operations or redirecting traffic.</p>\n  <h3>📡 Rogue Access Point (AP)</h3>\n  <p>An unauthorized wireless AP that can allow attackers access to the network.</p>\n  <h3>💻 Evil Twin Attack</h3>\n  <p>A rogue AP mimicking a legitimate network to steal user data or install malware.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛠️ On-Path Attack</h2>\n  <p>Also known as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), it involves intercepting communications between two parties without their knowledge.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Eavesdropping on secure web sessions or redirecting traffic.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧠 Social Engineering</h2>\n  <h3>📧 Phishing</h3>\n  <p>Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in emails.</p>\n  <h3>🗑️ Dumpster Diving</h3>\n  <p>Searching through trash to find confidential information.</p>\n  <h3>👀 Shoulder Surfing</h3>\n  <p>Stealing information by watching someone enter sensitive data.</p>\n  <h3>🚪 Tailgating</h3>\n  <p>Following an authorized person into a restricted area without credentials.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🦠 Malware</h2>\n  <p>Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise systems. Includes viruses, worms, spyware, ransomware, etc.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Infecting systems to steal data, disrupt services, or demand ransom.</p>\n</article>"
