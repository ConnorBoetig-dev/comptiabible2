    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔄 STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)</h2>\n  <p>STP is used to prevent network loops. A failure in STP can lead to broadcast storms and network instability.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring STP is enabled and configured correctly to avoid network loops in a redundant switch setup.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔁 Network Loops</h2>\n  <p>Network loops occur when there are multiple active paths between switches, which causes broadcast storms and network congestion.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Diagnosing network loops and ensuring that STP is configured to block redundant paths.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔑 Root Bridge Selection</h2>\n  <p>The root bridge is the central reference point in a network running STP. Incorrect root bridge selection can lead to suboptimal path selection and network inefficiencies.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking if the correct switch is elected as the root bridge and ensuring that other switches don't incorrectly claim the role.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛠️ Port Bridge Selection</h2>\n  <p>Port bridge selection determines the best path for data to travel in a switched network. Misconfigurations can cause inefficient routing and delays.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Reviewing STP settings to ensure the correct port roles (e.g., root, designated, blocking).</p>\n\n  <h2>🌐 Port Roles</h2>\n  <p>Different port roles determine how ports in a switch participate in data forwarding. Incorrect port roles can cause network outages.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring STP port roles are correctly configured to prevent loops and traffic bottlenecks.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛑 Port States</h2>\n  <p>Port states (e.g., Blocking, Listening, Learning, Forwarding) determine the function of switch ports in STP. Incorrect port states can cause traffic issues.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking STP port states to troubleshoot network connectivity problems.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌍 Incorrect VLAN Assignment</h2>\n  <p>Incorrect VLAN assignment can isolate devices on the same physical network. Ensuring proper VLAN configuration is critical for network segmentation.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Verifying VLANs and their assignments on switches to ensure devices in the same VLAN can communicate.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔒 ACLs (Access Control Lists)</h2>\n  <p>ACLs are used to filter traffic and enforce security policies. Misconfigured ACLs can block legitimate traffic or allow unauthorized access.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Reviewing ACL configurations to ensure only the correct traffic is allowed or denied.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛣️ Route Selection</h2>\n  <h3>🗺️ Routing Table</h3>\n  <p>The routing table determines how packets are forwarded in a network. Incorrect routes can lead to misdirected traffic.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking the routing table on routers to ensure all routes are correct and that there are no conflicting entries.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔑 Default Routes</h3>\n  <p>A default route (often called the \"gateway of last resort\") is used when no other routes match. A misconfigured default route can cause traffic to fail to reach its destination.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Verifying the default route in the routing table and ensuring it points to the correct gateway.</p>\n\n  <h3>🏙️ Address Pool Exhaustion</h3>\n  <p>Address pool exhaustion occurs when there are not enough IP addresses available for devices to use. This is common with DHCP or static IP assignments.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking the DHCP server or static IP assignments to ensure enough IP addresses are available.</p>\n\n  <h3>🚪 Incorrect Default Gateway</h3>\n  <p>An incorrect default gateway can prevent devices from accessing remote networks.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Verifying the default gateway settings on the device to ensure proper routing.</p>\n\n  <h3>🧩 Incorrect IP Address</h3>\n  <p>An incorrect IP address can prevent devices from communicating within the local network or the internet.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking and correcting the IP address on the device to ensure it is on the correct subnet.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 Duplicate IP Address</h3>\n  <p>A duplicate IP address can cause network conflicts and communication failure.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Checking the network for duplicate IP addresses and resolving the conflict by reassigning a unique address.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔢 Incorrect Subnet Mask</h3>\n  <p>An incorrect subnet mask can prevent a device from correctly identifying other devices on its local network, leading to connectivity issues.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Verifying the subnet mask on the device and comparing it with the network’s configuration to ensure proper communication.</p>\n</article>"
