They are used for troubleshooting and managing network hardware.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Visually represent the physical infrastructure in data centers.</p>\n\n  <h3>Logical Diagrams</h3>\n  <p>Logical diagrams represent the flow of data within the network. They show how devices communicate and the logical structure, without the constraints of physical layout.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Plan and visualize network architecture at a higher level.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Rack Diagrams</h2>\n  <p>Rack diagrams show the placement of devices (like servers, routers, and switches) within a physical rack. These are important for organizing equipment in data centers and managing space effectively.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Planning server rooms and data center setups.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Cable Maps and Diagrams</h2>\n  <p>These maps illustrate the physical wiring of the network. They detail where each cable connects and how the network is structured.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensure proper cable management and for troubleshooting cable-related issues.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🗺️ Network Diagrams</h2>\n  <p>These are high-level diagrams showing the connections between devices and networks, typically used to design and plan networks.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Layer 1: Physical connections (e.g., cables, devices).</li>\n    <li>Layer 2: Data link connections (e.g., switches).</li>\n    <li>Layer 3: Network layer connections (e.g., routers, IP addressing).</li>\n  </ul>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧰 Asset Inventory</h2>\n  <h3>🖥️ Hardware</h3>\n  <p>Keeping track of all network hardware (routers, switches, servers, etc.) in an inventory system is critical for maintenance, upgrades, and lifecycle management.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensure equipment is properly managed and available when needed.</p>\n\n  <h3>🛠️ Software</h3>\n  <p>Keeping track of all the software used in the network infrastructure, including operating systems, management tools, and networking software.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Helps manage licensing and updates.</p>\n\n  <h3>📜 Licensing</h3>\n  <p>Managing the licenses for software and hardware ensures that the organization is compliant and not overusing software beyond its licensing limits.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Avoid legal issues by ensuring proper licensing for all tools and devices.</p>\n\n  <h3>🛡️ Warranty Support</h3>\n  <p>Tracking the warranty status of hardware and devices ensures that the network can receive repairs or replacements when necessary, without additional costs.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Keeps track of warranty expiration dates to maintain coverage.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 IP Address Management (IPAM)</h2>\n  <p>IP address management involves organizing and managing IP addresses within a network, including the allocation, classification, and monitoring of IP address usage.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensure efficient use of IP addresses and avoid conflicts, especially in large or complex networks.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Life-cycle Management</h2>\n  <h3>🛑 End-of-Life (EOL)</h3>\n  <p>EOL refers to the point at which a device, software, or hardware is no longer sold or supported by the manufacturer. At EOL, there are no more updates, security patches, or official support.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Plan for replacement or upgrade to avoid using outdated or unsupported systems.</p>\n\n  <h3>🛠️ End-of-Support (EOS)</h3>\n  <p>EOS is the point when the manufacturer no longer provides technical support or assistance for a product. While the product may still work, any issues that arise may not be resolved.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Organizations should plan to migrate to a supported system or platform before EOS to maintain security and functionality.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>💻 Software Management</h2>\n  <h3>Patches and Bug Fixes</h3>\n  <p>Software management involves regularly applying patches and fixes to address vulnerabilities or issues in the software, ensuring systems remain secure and reliable.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Regular patching is critical for security, especially for operating systems and network devices.</p>\n\n  <h3>Operating System (OS)</h3>\n  <p>Management of operating systems involves maintaining OS updates, security patches, and version control to ensure they continue to meet the needs of the network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring all network devices are running supported versions of their operating systems for security and performance.</p>\n\n  <h3>Firmware</h3>\n  <p>Firmware management involves maintaining and updating the low-level software on hardware devices (like routers and switches). This is crucial for security and device functionality.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Updating firmware to improve device performance or patch security vulnerabilities.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔒 Decommissioning</h2>\n  <p>Decommissioning involves safely retiring hardware or software that is no longer useful or has reached EOL. It includes removing the device from the network, wiping data, and ensuring it's properly disposed of.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensures that no sensitive data is leaked and that the retired equipment is either securely stored or recycled.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔄 Change Management</h2>\n  <h3>Request Process Tracking/Service Request</h3>\n  <p>Change management involves tracking all changes to the network environment. This includes managing service requests and ensuring that changes are well-documented and approved.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensure any network or infrastructure changes are tracked and implemented according to company procedures.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>⚙️ Configuration Management</h2>\n  <h3>🏭 Production Configuration</h3>\n  <p>This refers to the configuration of network devices and systems that are in live, operational use. It's crucial that production configurations are properly documented and protected to prevent accidental changes that could disrupt operations.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used to ensure that all operational equipment is configured to support the network's business goals.</p>\n\n  <h3>📦 Backup Configuration</h3>\n  <p>Backup configurations are stored copies of the production configuration, created to restore a device’s settings in case of failure or misconfiguration.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensures a quick recovery in case of system failure or configuration errors.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔑 Baseline/Golden Configuration</h3>\n  <p>A baseline or golden configuration is a standard configuration that all devices on the network should follow. It serves as a reference point for any future changes and helps ensure uniformity across the network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Reduces configuration errors by ensuring that all devices are set up according to the same specifications.</p>\n</article>"
