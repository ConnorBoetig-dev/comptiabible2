    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🔌 Disable Unused Ports and Services</h2>\n  <p>Disabling unused ports and services minimizes potential attack vectors. These unused resources are often overlooked and could be exploited by attackers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Turning off unnecessary services like FTP, Telnet, or SMB to reduce vulnerability.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛑 Change Default Passwords</h2>\n  <p>Changing default passwords from factory settings is a critical part of device hardening, as attackers often exploit default passwords to gain unauthorized access.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring every network device has a strong, unique password instead of the default ones provided by the manufacturer.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 Network Access Control (NAC)</h2>\n  <h3>🔌 Port Security</h3>\n  <p>Port security is used on network switches to restrict the devices that can connect to a network via a physical port.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Only allow specific MAC addresses to access a port to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔑 802.1X</h3>\n  <p>802.1X is a network access control protocol that provides authentication to devices attempting to access the network. It’s typically used in wireless and wired networks to ensure only authenticated users can connect.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used to secure wireless networks and restrict unauthorized access by requiring user credentials before granting access.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔏 MAC Filtering</h3>\n  <p>MAC filtering involves restricting network access based on the MAC address of devices attempting to connect. Only approved MAC addresses are allowed to access the network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Allowing known devices to access a network while blocking unapproved ones, though it can be bypassed by attackers who spoof MAC addresses.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🛡️ Security Rules</h2>\n  <h3>🚪 Access Control List (ACL)</h3>\n  <p>An ACL is a list of rules used to control access to network resources based on IP addresses, protocols, or other identifiers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Defining which users or systems can access certain network resources, like allowing certain IP ranges to access a server while blocking others.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌐 URL Filtering</h3>\n  <p>URL filtering controls user access to websites by blocking URLs that are deemed harmful or inappropriate.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Blocking access to malicious or non-business-related websites in a corporate environment.</p>\n\n  <h3>📑 Content Filtering</h3>\n  <p>Content filtering restricts access to specific types of content, such as malware, inappropriate websites, or files that may contain harmful content.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Blocking adult content, social media, or sites known for malware.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏙️ Zones</h2>\n  <h3>🛡️ Trusted vs. Untrusted Zones</h3>\n  <p>Network security zones divide a network into segments with different levels of trust:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Trusted zones:</strong> Areas of the network considered secure (e.g., internal networks).</li>\n    <li><strong>Untrusted zones:</strong> Areas where untrusted traffic may originate, such as the internet.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Firewalls often separate trusted internal networks from untrusted external networks, like the internet.</p>\n\n  <h3>🛑 Screened Subnet</h3>\n  <p>A screened subnet (or DMZ) is a buffer zone between an internal network and the external network (e.g., the internet). It houses resources that need to be accessed from both internal and external users, like web servers or mail servers.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Placing public-facing services like a web server in the DMZ to protect the internal network from direct exposure to the internet.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔑 Key Management</h2>\n  <p>Key management is the process of managing cryptographic keys throughout their lifecycle, ensuring they are securely generated, stored, distributed, and retired.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensuring that encryption keys used in VPNs, secure communications, or file encryption are kept secure and periodically rotated.</p>\n</article>"
