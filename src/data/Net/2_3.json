    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>📡 Channel Width</h2>\n  <p>The channel width refers to the bandwidth allocated for a wireless signal. Wider channels (e.g., 40 MHz, 80 MHz, or 160 MHz) allow more data to pass through, increasing speed but possibly causing more interference.</p>\n\n  <h2>📡 Non-Overlapping Channels</h2>\n  <p>In wireless networking, non-overlapping channels are crucial for minimizing interference. For example, in the 2.4 GHz range, channels 1, 6, and 11 are commonly used since they do not overlap.</p>\n\n  <h2>⚖️ Regulatory Impacts</h2>\n  <p>Regulations vary by country and region, affecting which frequencies are allowed for use. For instance, 802.11h is a standard that ensures compliance with regulations in certain regions (e.g., Europe) for radar avoidance.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📶 Frequency Options</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 2.4 GHz</h3>\n  <p>This is the most commonly used frequency band, providing longer range but less bandwidth and more interference (due to many devices using the same band).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Basic home networks, IoT devices.</p>\n\n  <h3>⚡ 5 GHz</h3>\n  <p>The 5 GHz band offers faster speeds and less interference, but has a shorter range compared to 2.4 GHz. It’s less congested and typically used for modern wireless standards.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> High-bandwidth activities like gaming and streaming.</p>\n\n  <h3>📡 6 GHz</h3>\n  <p>The 6 GHz band is the newest addition to Wi-Fi technology (Wi-Fi 6E), offering even faster speeds and less congestion due to its additional available spectrum.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Newer devices supporting Wi-Fi 6E.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔄 Band Steering</h3>\n  <p>Band steering is a feature that automatically moves devices from the 2.4 GHz band to the 5 GHz band for better performance, especially in environments with lots of devices.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🏷️ Service Set Identifier (SSID)</h2>\n  <h3>🔑 Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID)</h3>\n  <p>BSSID is the unique identifier for a wireless access point (AP) in a network. It is typically the MAC address of the AP.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔑 Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID)</h3>\n  <p>ESSID refers to the name of a wireless network, which is broadcasted by the AP. Multiple APs can share the same ESSID to extend network coverage.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 Network Types</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 Mesh Networks</h3>\n  <p>Mesh networks consist of multiple access points that are all connected, extending the network’s coverage without needing a central router. Each AP can communicate with others, ensuring continuous coverage.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Large homes, offices, or environments that require seamless connectivity.</p>\n\n  <h3>📡 Ad Hoc</h3>\n  <p>Ad hoc networks are temporary, direct connections between devices without the need for an access point or router.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Peer-to-peer communication, file sharing in short-range scenarios.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔗 Point to Point</h3>\n  <p>A point-to-point network connects two devices directly, typically for backhaul links or dedicated connections between two sites.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Remote office or building-to-building connections.</p>\n\n  <h3>🖧 Infrastructure</h3>\n  <p>Infrastructure mode involves devices connecting through an access point, where the AP serves as the central hub for communication. This is the most common type of network used for home and business wireless networks.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔒 Encryption</h2>\n  <h3>🔐 Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)</h3>\n  <p>WPA2 is the most commonly used encryption standard for securing Wi-Fi networks. It uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encryption and provides a strong level of security, though it is susceptible to certain attacks if weak passwords are used.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Most Wi-Fi networks in homes and businesses.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔑 WPA3</h3>\n  <p>WPA3 is the latest Wi-Fi security protocol, offering stronger encryption and improved security, especially for public networks and weak passwords. It includes features like Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and 192-bit encryption for higher security.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Newer devices and high-security networks.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🧳 Guest Networks</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 Captive Portals</h3>\n  <p>Captive portals are web pages that users are redirected to when connecting to a guest network. They typically require users to log in, accept terms, or enter a password before gaining access to the internet.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Public Wi-Fi in cafes, hotels, or offices.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔑 Authentication</h2>\n  <h3>🔒 Pre-Shared Key (PSK) vs. Enterprise</h3>\n  <p>PSK: A simple authentication method where all devices on the network share a common password (Wi-Fi key). It is easy to set up but not scalable for large networks.</p>\n  <p>Enterprise: Enterprise-level authentication uses protocols like RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) for stronger, centralized authentication. This is typically used in businesses and larger environments where individual user authentication is required.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📡 Antennas</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 Omnidirectional vs. Directional</h3>\n  <p>Omnidirectional: These antennas broadcast signal in all directions, providing uniform coverage in all angles (360 degrees).</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> General Wi-Fi coverage in home or office networks.</p>\n  <p>Directional: These antennas focus the signal in a specific direction, providing a longer range in that direction.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Point-to-point connections or long-range connections between two devices.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📶 Autonomous vs. Lightweight Access Point</h2>\n  <h3>Autonomous Access Point</h3>\n  <p>An autonomous access point operates independently and does not require a controller to function. It can be configured and managed individually.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Small networks where centralized management is not needed.</p>\n\n  <h3>Lightweight Access Point</h3>\n  <p>A lightweight access point is managed centrally by a wireless controller. The AP itself is \"lightweight\" and simply passes traffic to the controller for configuration and management.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Large enterprise networks where multiple APs need centralized management for easier scaling and control.</p>\n</article>"
