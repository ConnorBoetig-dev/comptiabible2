    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🖧 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</h2>\n  <h3>Reservations</h3>\n  <p>DHCP reservations ensure that a specific device always gets the same IP address from the DHCP server based on its MAC address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Assigning static IPs to devices like printers, servers, and network equipment without manually configuring them.</p>\n\n  <h3>Scope</h3>\n  <p>The DHCP scope defines the range of IP addresses that can be assigned to devices within a network.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Limits the pool of available IP addresses based on the size of the network.</p>\n\n  <h3>Lease Time</h3>\n  <p>Lease time specifies how long a device can use an assigned IP address before it must renew the lease.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Typically set to a few hours or days depending on network needs.</p>\n\n  <h3>Options</h3>\n  <p>DHCP options allow additional settings to be provided to devices during IP assignment, such as DNS servers or default gateways.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Configure network devices with necessary settings (e.g., DNS servers).</p>\n\n  <h3>Relay/IP Helper</h3>\n  <p>A relay agent forwards DHCP requests between clients and servers, especially when the client is on a different subnet.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in larger networks where clients are located in different subnets than the DHCP server.</p>\n\n  <h3>Exclusions</h3>\n  <p>Exclusions define IP addresses within the scope that should not be assigned to devices. This is often used for IP addresses that need to be manually assigned.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Prevent the DHCP server from assigning IPs to devices that should have static IPs.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌍 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC)</h2>\n  <p>SLAAC allows a device to automatically configure its own IPv6 address without the need for a DHCP server. The device uses information from the local network (router advertisements) to generate its own address.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Devices in IPv6 networks use SLAAC for automatic addressing in the absence of a DHCP server.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>⏰ Time Protocols</h2>\n  <h3>⏱️ NTP (Network Time Protocol)</h3>\n  <p>NTP is a protocol used to synchronize the clocks of devices over a network to ensure accurate timekeeping. It uses a client-server model, where the client requests time from a server.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Ensures that all devices in a network have the same time for logging and timestamping activities.</p>\n\n  <h3>🕒 Precision Time Protocol (PTP)</h3>\n  <p>PTP is a more precise version of NTP, designed for applications that require very accurate time synchronization, often down to the nanosecond.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in high-precision environments like financial networks, industrial automation, and telecommunications.</p>\n\n  <h3>🛡️ Network Time Security (NTS)</h3>\n  <p>NTS enhances NTP by adding encryption and authentication to prevent tampering with time synchronization. This ensures that time data cannot be maliciously altered.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Used in environments where security is critical and time accuracy must be maintained without interference.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌍 Name Resolution</h2>\n  <h3>🌐 DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>\n  <p>DNS is the service that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that machines use to communicate.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔐 DNSSEC</h3>\n  <p>DNSSEC adds security to DNS by allowing DNS responses to be verified for authenticity, helping to prevent attacks like cache poisoning.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔒 DoH and DoT</h3>\n  <p>DoH and DoT encrypt DNS queries, making them more secure by preventing third parties from intercepting or modifying them.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📜 Record Types</h2>\n  <h3>🔑 A</h3>\n  <p>Maps a domain name to its IPv4 address.</p>\n\n  <h3>🌍 AAAA</h3>\n  <p>Maps a domain name to its IPv6 address.</p>\n\n  <h3>🏷️ CNAME</h3>\n  <p>Points one domain name to another domain name.</p>\n\n  <h3>📧 MX</h3>\n  <p>Specifies the mail servers for a domain.</p>\n\n  <h3>📝 TXT</h3>\n  <p>Stores text-based information, often used for email security (e.g., SPF).</p>\n\n  <h3>🖧 NS</h3>\n  <p>Specifies the DNS servers authoritative for a domain.</p>\n\n  <h3>🧭 PTR</h3>\n  <p>Used for reverse DNS lookups (IP to domain name).</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🔢 Zone Types</h2>\n  <h3>🔄 Forward</h3>\n  <p>Used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔙 Reverse</h3>\n  <p>Used to resolve IP addresses to domain names.</p>\n\n  <h3>🧭 Authoritative vs. Non-Authoritative</h3>\n  <p><strong>Authoritative:</strong> The DNS server that holds the original records.</p>\n  <p><strong>Non-Authoritative:</strong> A server that caches results but doesn’t own the original data.</p>\n\n  <h3>🏢 Primary vs. Secondary</h3>\n  <p><strong>Primary:</strong> Holds the original zone data and is where updates are made.</p>\n  <p><strong>Secondary:</strong> A backup copy of the primary zone data.</p>\n\n  <h3>🔁 Recursive</h3>\n  <p>Resolves queries by contacting other DNS servers on behalf of the client.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>📝 Hosts File</h2>\n  <p>The hosts file is a local text file used by operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses. It overrides DNS and is useful for testing or internal mappings.</p>\n  <p><strong>Common use:</strong> Manually setting up domain mappings before DNS propagation or for testing purposes.</p>\n</article>"
