    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>🖥️ Application Aware</h2>\n  <p>SDN and SD-WAN solutions are application-aware, meaning they can dynamically adjust network resources based on the requirements of applications. For example, they prioritize critical applications (e.g., video conferencing, VoIP) to ensure performance.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔧 Zero-Touch Provisioning</h2>\n  <p>This is an automation feature that allows network devices (like routers or switches) to be configured automatically with minimal manual intervention. Devices are pre-configured and can be plugged in and work out of the box.</p>\n\n  <h2>🚚 Transport Agnostic</h2>\n  <p>SDN and SD-WAN are transport-agnostic, meaning they can work over various types of network connections such as MPLS, broadband, or cellular networks, without being tied to any specific type of transport infrastructure.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔑 Central Policy Management</h2>\n  <p>With SD-WAN and SDN, policies (like security rules and traffic management rules) are centrally managed, allowing consistent policy enforcement across distributed network devices and locations.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔄 Virtual Extensible Local Area Network (VXLAN)</h2>\n  <p>VXLAN is a network virtualization technology used to create isolated Layer 2 segments over a Layer 3 network. This allows for scalable network architectures, especially in multi-tenant cloud environments.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌉 Data Center Interconnect (DCI)</h2>\n  <p>DCI refers to the methods used to connect multiple data centers in a geographically dispersed network. VXLAN is often used in this scenario to extend Layer 2 networks over long distances, supporting data center growth and flexibility.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌐 Layer 2 Encapsulation</h2>\n  <p>VXLAN provides Layer 2 encapsulation over a Layer 3 network, allowing the creation of virtualized networks that can span across physical boundaries.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔐 Secure Access Secure Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE)</h2>\n  <p>SASE is an integrated network and security service model that combines wide area network (WAN) capabilities with security functions like secure web gateways (SWG), firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS), and zero trust network access (ZTNA).</p>\n  <p><strong>Key benefit:</strong> Allows organizations to secure access to applications and data no matter where users are located, ensuring secure, fast, and reliable connections.</p>\n  <p>SSE focuses specifically on the security aspect of SASE. It encompasses all security capabilities that are delivered via the cloud (e.g., web security, data protection, and threat intelligence).</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>⚙️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>\n  <h3>🔄 Automation</h3>\n  <p><strong>Playbooks/Templates/Reusable Tasks:</strong> IaC involves using automated scripts or templates (like Terraform or CloudFormation) to create and configure infrastructure. These templates can be reused for consistent deployments, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.</p>\n  <h3>Configuration Drift/Compliance</h3>\n  <p>IaC helps prevent configuration drift (when infrastructure deviates from the desired state) by ensuring that the infrastructure is consistently updated according to the latest templates, keeping it compliant with policies.</p>\n  <h3>Upgrades</h3>\n  <p>IaC allows for automated infrastructure upgrades, making it easier to deploy updates or patches to the infrastructure without manual intervention, reducing errors and downtime.</p>\n  <h3>Dynamic Inventories</h3>\n  <p>IaC solutions dynamically manage inventories of infrastructure components, allowing the automatic detection and management of new or modified infrastructure.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🗂️ Source Control</h2>\n  <h3>Version Control</h3>\n  <p>IaC tools integrate with version control systems (like Git) to track changes in infrastructure code, enabling rollback, auditability, and collaboration on code updates.</p>\n  <h3>Central Repository</h3>\n  <p>The code is stored in a central repository, ensuring all team members can access the same version of infrastructure definitions, promoting consistency and transparency.</p>\n  <h3>Conflict Identification</h3>\n  <p>By using version control, any conflicts or changes to the infrastructure code can be easily identified and resolved, ensuring alignment across teams.</p>\n  <h3>Branching</h3>\n  <p>IaC repositories allow for branching, so developers can work on new features or changes in isolated environments before merging them into the main codebase.</p>\n</article>\n\n<article>\n  <h2>🌐 IPv6 Addressing</h2>\n  <h3>🚪 Mitigating Address Exhaustion</h3>\n  <p>IPv6 solves the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion by providing a vast address space, with an address length of 128 bits compared to the 32-bit length of IPv4. This ensures enough IP addresses for the growing number of devices connected to the internet.</p>\n  <h3>⚙️ Compatibility Requirements</h3>\n  <h4>Tunneling</h4>\n  <p>Tunneling is a technique used to transmit IPv6 packets over an IPv4 network. This is essential for organizations transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6, as it allows for the coexistence of both protocols during the migration.</p>\n  <h4>Dual Stack</h4>\n  <p>A dual stack network supports both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously, allowing devices to communicate over either protocol. It provides backward compatibility while transitioning to IPv6.</p>\n  <h4>NAT64</h4>\n  <p>Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) enables communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only networks by translating IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and vice versa.</p>\n</article>"
