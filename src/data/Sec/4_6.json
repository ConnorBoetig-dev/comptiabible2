    "content": "<article>\n  <h2>👥 Provisioning / De-Provisioning User Accounts</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Provisioning: Create and assign user accounts with the right access.</li>\n    <li>De-provisioning: Disable or remove access immediately when no longer needed—prevents orphaned accounts.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>🎚️ Permission Assignments & Implications</h2>\n  <p>Grant only the access needed for a user’s role. Over-permissioning increases the risk of insider threats or misuse.</p>\n\n  <h2>🧾 Identity Proofing</h2>\n  <p>Verifies that a user is who they claim to be before issuing credentials—often part of onboarding or account recovery.</p>\n\n  <h2>🌐 Federation</h2>\n  <p>Allows users to access multiple systems across organizations with a single identity (e.g., logging into a partner service with your Google account).</p>\n\n  <h2>🔑 Single Sign-On (SSO)</h2>\n  <p>User logs in once to access multiple systems—improves usability, but requires strong central security.</p>\n\n  <h2>🧠 LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</h2>\n  <p>Centralized directory of users—used for authentication and querying identity info.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔓 OAuth (Open Authorization)</h2>\n  <p>Allows third-party apps to access user data without sharing passwords (used by Google, Facebook logins).</p>\n\n  <h2>📜 SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)</h2>\n  <p>XML-based framework for exchanging authentication and authorization data—common in enterprise SSO.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔄 Interoperability</h2>\n  <p>Ensures different identity systems can work together—vital in hybrid or multi-vendor environments.</p>\n\n  <h2>🧾 Attestation</h2>\n  <p>User or system confirms a specific attribute (e.g., device posture, location) as part of authentication—can feed into access decisions.</p>\n\n  <h2>🛂 Access Controls</h2>\n  <h3>🔐 Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</h3>\n  <p>Strict, centrally enforced access—users can’t change permissions (used in military/government systems).</p>\n  <h3>🧍 Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</h3>\n  <p>Owners of data/resources decide who has access—flexible, but more prone to misuse.</p>\n  <h3>👥 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>\n  <p>Access is assigned based on a user's job role—easy to manage across large organizations.</p>\n  <h3>🧾 Rule-Based Access Control</h3>\n  <p>Access is granted based on pre-defined rules (e.g., firewall ACLs, conditions).</p>\n  <h3>🧬 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</h3>\n  <p>Access decisions are based on user attributes (e.g., department, clearance level, device type).</p>\n  <h3>⏰ Time-of-Day Restrictions</h3>\n  <p>Access allowed only during certain hours—limits risk during off-hours.</p>\n  <h3>🪪 Least Privilege</h3>\n  <p>Users are given the minimum access needed to do their job—reduces attack surface.</p>\n\n  <h2>🔒 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</h2>\n  <h3>💡 Implementations</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧬 Biometrics: Fingerprints, face scans, iris recognition—unique to each user.</li>\n    <li>🔐 Hard/Soft Authentication Tokens:</li>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Hard: Physical devices like RSA tokens.</li>\n      <li>Soft: Apps (e.g., Google Authenticator) on phones.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <li>🔑 Security Keys: Hardware-based tokens (e.g., YubiKey) that support standards like FIDO2/WebAuthn.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>🧠 Factors</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 Something You Know: Passwords, PINs.</li>\n    <li>📱 Something You Have: Token, smart card, mobile device.</li>\n    <li>🧬 Something You Are: Biometrics.</li>\n    <li>📍 Somewhere You Are: Geographic location used to allow/deny access.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>🔑 Password Concepts</h2>\n  <h3>📏 Password Best Practices</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>📐 Length: Longer is stronger—12+ characters recommended to withstand brute force attacks.</li>\n    <li>🔀 Complexity: Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols—avoids easy-to-guess passwords.</li>\n    <li>🔁 Reuse: Never reuse passwords across accounts—if one gets breached, the others are vulnerable too.</li>\n    <li>⌛ Expiration: Policies may require regular password changes—but only when necessary (e.g., after compromise).</li>\n    <li>🧓 Age: Minimum age prevents rapid cycling through password history just to reuse old ones.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>🔐 Password Managers</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Securely store and autofill complex passwords—encourages strong, unique passwords per account.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h3>🛑 Passwordless</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Uses biometrics, tokens, or other factors instead of passwords—reduces phishing and credential theft risk.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2>🧰 Privileged Access Management (PAM) Tools</h2>\n  <h3>⏱️ Just-in-Time Permissions</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Temporary elevated access granted only when needed—reduces standing privilege risk.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>🏦 Password Vaulting</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Stores privileged credentials in a secure, encrypted vault—access is logged and audited.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <h3>🕓 Ephemeral Credentials</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li>One-time or short-lived credentials—automatically expire after use to prevent reuse or abuse.</li>\n  </ul>\n</article>"
